Java lombok is able to process users annotation and inject the 
necessary method and other code to the annotated class. This article
gives a breif example of how this can be implemented in Java. 
The technique used to generate this is still using lombok's 
library but the idea is there. So good starting document
to learn about the annotation processing and method injection.
